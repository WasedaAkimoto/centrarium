It was a late afternoon when I saw her profile in summer's list. She passed my exam with a full mark because she thought I was 
intended to play the games with her reading her post of searching a game partner. Actually I cannot remember whether I noticed 
her in the nearby list or posts.

The conversation at first, I could remember it was a little embarassed when I led the topic to How is Shanghai Men like hahaha. 
But most fortuantely, I contacted her again when I was in Nanjing karaoking in Mid-Autumn Festival. We made a fantastic misunderstanding 
that she said she had no plan on vacation and Shanghai Zoo was a wonderful place, where people could make appointment there. I took the 
wrong meaning of words that she could come out if appointment. I was a little shocked and replied we could have a meal together when I was
back to Shanghai. She obviously felt curious, "Why did you make an invitation so suddenly haha?" Both of us laughed as we figured the 
misunderstanding out. It strengthened our relationship just due to an unexpected misunderstanding.
