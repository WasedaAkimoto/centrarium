It was the first day we made appointment. We chose a restaurant in Xujiahui in the middle point between us. I proposed, “The rice wine seems yummy and I guess it’s not a kind of strong wine.” Later the waiter served us a big pot and we shocked. But then we quickly drunk together with great pleasure. And at last just as the figure shows, she cannot control herself walking straightly. Even she had to hugged the electric pod in the street to keep balance hhhhhhhhhh. I swear I won’t forget the situation forever.
