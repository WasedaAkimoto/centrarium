I went to Zhongbei Campus to wait for her finishing tutoring class. When I saw her near the school gate, two bunches of flowers were held in her hands. At first I didnâ€™t figure out where the flowers were from and thought someone sent to her as a gift, I even made an inquiry to her...(silly) 
She bought a little daisy to me and the one for herself was jasmine. Actually I have no knowledge about the plant and feel intractable to recognize different types, which was greatly laughed at. She was also mad at me that I thought the colour of daisy was single hahaha. <font color="blue">I guarantee I would take care of the daisy by heart, we will see the flower blossoms together.</font>
