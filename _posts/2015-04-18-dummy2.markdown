Enlightened by Tokyo suspension girls, YCH and I took the photographs and processed the following suspension photos.

Actually the procedure is not complecated, just need some carefulness and patience.

# 1.Comparation Before Taking Photos 
First of all, we need a camera and tripod. Because it's hard to get a series of photos that possess completely the same background without tripod. And it's necessary to compare the upholder ahead of time, which should have smallest land area and regular shape as much as possible. 
  
# 2.Taking Photos  
Just as the figure shows, we took the photos of people and objects crutched by chair and hand. Also, the land area should be as small as possible. The procedure of taking photos should be as rapid as possible due to the light and shadow change minutely.

Open the photoshop, put the background on the bottem and the figure and objects on the top layer, extract the graph.

While processing the photos, I found there were many that Bobo existed, so I contain it in the photos by the way. And modify the photos a little.

# 4.Achievement

This way, we finally succeed making suspension photos. It took around several hours during the whole procedure, isn't it very tractable?
At last, I wanna post some GIFs to show gratitude to my companion.
